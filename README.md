Front end is building off of the d3.js example:
http://bertranddechoux.github.io/d3js-sandbox/mower-demo/index.html

KNOWN BUGS TO BE FIXED:
1. We need to build a clear hierarchy for display (right now when you lay a mine down, the square turns yellow instead of remaining black

OTHER THINGS TO DO:
right now, tool information in the index.html is displayed in a clumsy pseudo-table format but this should be reformatted into an actual table which I hear are built into HTML

arrow.py has functions that are used for user to shoot an arrow up,left,downright [W,A,S,D]  or sheild [SPACEBAR}

carry.py has funcions that are used for pickup of blocks from above,left, below, right [W,A,S,D] and placing of blocks at current spot [SPACEBAR}

mine.py has functions that are used for laying down a mine [SPACEBAR] on the current square

move.py has functions that are used for moving a user around

screen-info.py has functions that are used for accessing information about the screen.  

spawn.py has functions that are used for recreating a player has lost all health
